      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Denmark Visit/Tourist Visa Details</h2>
      <p>
        The Denmark Visit/Tourist Visa is a short-stay Schengen visa, allowing you to travel to Denmark for tourism purposes. As Denmark is a member of the Schengen Area, this visa also grants you access to other countries within the Schengen Zone for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This makes it perfect for travellers who wish to explore not just Denmark but also other European nations.
