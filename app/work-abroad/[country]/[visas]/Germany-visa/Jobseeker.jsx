        The Germany Jobseeker Visa allows qualified professionals from non-EU countries to travel to Germany for up to six months to search for a job. This visa is designed for individuals who have the skills and qualifications that are in demand in Germany’s labour market but don’t yet have a concrete job offer.

        During the visa’s validity, you can attend interviews, network with potential employers, and explore job prospects in various industries. Once you secure a job offer, you can apply for a residence permit to live and work in Germany.
