    The UK Short-Term Work Visa, also referred to as the Temporary Work Visa (T5), is a category designed for individuals who wish to work in the United Kingdom for up to 6–12 months, depending on the subcategory. Whether you're applying under the Seasonal Worker Visa, Charity Worker Visa, or Government Authorised Exchange, this visa opens the door to valuable work experience in the UK without a long-term commitment.
