            <h2 className="text-xl mt-3 font-bold">What is the UK Tier 4 Student Visa?</h2>
            <p>
              The UK Tier 4 (General) Student Visa, now known as the Student Route Visa, allows international students to live and study in the UK for courses longer than 6 months. This visa is essential if you're planning to pursue undergraduate, postgraduate, or doctoral degrees at recognized UK institutions.
