      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-black">🌱 What is the Dubai Green Visa?</h2>
      <p>
        The Dubai Green Visa is a long-term residency visa introduced by the UAE government to attract skilled
        professionals, entrepreneurs, investors, and freelancers. Unlike traditional employment visas, the Green Visa
        offers independence from employer sponsorship, giving you greater freedom and flexibility in your
        professional journey.

        This visa is part of the UAE’s visionary effort to diversify its economy and empower a global talent pool. It is
        valid for 5 years, with easy renewal options.
