      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-3">What is the Australia Employer 186 Visa?</h2>
      <p>
        The Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) 186 visa allows skilled workers nominated by an
        Australian employer to live and work in Australia permanently. This visa is ideal for
        employers who are struggling to find skilled workers locally and for professionals seeking
        to advance their careers in a dynamic, multicultural economy. Whether you are looking to
        hire or seeking an opportunity as an international worker, <span className="text-orange-600">VJC Overseas</span> provides expert
        advice and services to navigate the complex immigration process.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Salary Structure and Compensation in Australia</h2>
      <p>

        for the occupation in question. This ensures that employees are paid fairly for their work,
        in line with the prevailing wage standards in Australia.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Salary Range:</strong> AUD 50,000 to AUD 120,000 annually, depending on occupation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Pay:</strong> Employers must ensure compensation aligns with industry standards.</li>
        <li>The Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT) is currently set at AUD 53,900 per year.</li>
      </ul>
