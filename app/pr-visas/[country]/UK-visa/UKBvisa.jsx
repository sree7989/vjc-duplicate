        The UK Permanent Residence Visa allows non-British nationals to live and work in the UK indefinitely. After holding this status for a specified period, typically 5 years, applicants can apply for British citizenship. This visa is a major step for individuals looking to settle in the UK and enjoy all the rights and privileges that come with being a permanent resident.
